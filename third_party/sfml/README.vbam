This includes a modified version of the SFML library, which is used by the VBA-M
emulator. The original SFML library can be found at http://www.sfml-dev.org/

This uses SFML 2.6.2 as a basis, with the following modifications:
* Upstream commit [9022d956](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/commit/9022d956) was
  backported to fix a compilation failure with modern Clang.
* `<timeapi.h>` was added as an include in `src\SFML\System\Win32\SleepImpl.cpp`
  to fix a compilation failure with MSVC.
